<p> Category: Lecture<br /></p>
<p> When: 23/01/2018 (16:30-18:00)</p></p>
<p><p>This talk by João Campos, son of the 2014 presidential candidate Eduardo Campos, Chief of Staff of the Governor of Pernambuco Paulo Camara, will consider Pernambuco after Eduardo Campos. It is open to all on a first come, first served basis - not registration is required.</p></p>
<p><p>João was born in Recife, the capital of the state of Pernambuco, in the northeast of Brazil. He is the son of Eduardo Campos and great-grandson of Miguel Arraes, ex-governors Pernambuco and nationally renowned and respected politicians in Brazil.</p></p>
<p><p>He started his undergraduate studies in civil engineering at the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE) at the age of 17. During his undergraduate studies he was a research assistant on a research project studying floods. His undergraduate degree dissertation thesis was on the semi-arid region (a regional micro-climate within North-eastern Brazil), studying water problems. As a teenager he started frequent visits to this underdeveloped countryside region, focusing his energy and interest on it.</p></p>
<p><p>During his undergraduate studies he was also a visiting student for four months in the UK. During this visit in 2013 he also participated in an important trade round and seminar regarding business opportunities in the state of Pernambuco. The event was attended by over 150 businessmen and took place in London.</p></p>
<p><p>João has always been interested in politics and has attended political events and campaigns since his childhood. He has participated in political campaigns in 2006, 2010, 2012 and 2016. In recognition of his political activities, in 2014 he was elected secretary of the board of the Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB) committee in Pernambuco.</p></p>
<p><p>Due to his experience in political campaigns and his active engagement in the local party, he was invited by the governor of Pernambuco to the role of chief of staff. The chief of staff is responsible, among other things, to lead the entire staff employed by the governor’s office, advise the governor and organise and decide the political and administrative meetings that the governor will attend. Such a role offers him the opportunity to better understand the state machinery, and to develop the full economic and social picture of the state of Pernambuco.</p></p>
