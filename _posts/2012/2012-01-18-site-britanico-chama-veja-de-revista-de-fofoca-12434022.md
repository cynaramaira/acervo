<p>Ao repercutir o suposto caso de estupro que resultou na elimina&ccedil;&atilde;o do modelo Daniel do &lsquo;Big Brother Brasil 12&rsquo;, o site da revista brit&acirc;nica The Week se referiu a Veja com um termo tanto quanto peculiar. A p&aacute;gina inglesa afirmou que a publica&ccedil;&atilde;o da Editora Abril &eacute; &ldquo;brazilian gossip magazine&rdquo;, ou seja, uma revista brasileira de fofoca, em tradu&ccedil;&atilde;o livre.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A Week publicou que a vers&atilde;o online da Veja informou que a pol&iacute;cia do Rio de Janeiro &ndash; cidade onde os integrantes do &lsquo;BBB&rsquo; ficam confinados &ndash; est&aacute; investigando os sete minutos do v&iacute;deo que mostra os participantes Daniel e Monique embaixo do edredom.&nbsp; O ve&iacute;culo brit&acirc;nico ressalta que a Veja.com divulgou que n&atilde;o houve alega&ccedil;&atilde;o de crime por parte de nenhum dos &lsquo;BBBs&rsquo;.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>O site da The Week n&atilde;o citou apenas a Veja em sua mat&eacute;ria, publicada &agrave;s 12h50 desta ter&ccedil;a-feira, 17. O texto afirma que a TV Globo, emissora respons&aacute;vel por produzir e transmitir a vers&atilde;o brasileira do reality show, est&aacute; sendo alvo de um manifesto que j&aacute; conta com a ades&atilde;o de mais de 700 pessoas. O objetivo do protesto, segundo o ve&iacute;culo brit&acirc;nico, &eacute; fazer o canal assumir a responsabilidade pelo caso.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At&eacute; &agrave;s 19h desta ter&ccedil;a, a revista Veja n&atilde;o comentou o fato de ter sido classificada como uma publica&ccedil;&atilde;o de fofoca.</p></p>

<p><p>Contestant expelled after climbing under the covers with unconscious woman<br /></p>
<p>LAST UPDATED AT 12:50 ON TUE 17 JAN 2012<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>POLICE in Brazil have opened an inquiry into claims that one of the contestants in the country's Big Brother reality TV show may have been raped or sexually assaulted by another housemate while unconscious and drunk at the weekend.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>According to US website Jezebel, &quot;The episode in question showed contestant Monique Amin passed out drunk in bed, with male co-star Daniel Echaniz moving on top of her&quot;. It notes that both were under a blanket at the time.<br /></p>
<p>thinks she may have been raped, and many are criticising the show's producers for quite literally standing by and watching it happen.&quot;<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>On Monday, 31-year-old Echaniz was expelled from the house in the wake of a campaign on Twitter in Brazil to have him removed. He later took to the social networking site to defend himself. In one tweet he wrote: &quot;I am against any violence or abuse. Anyone who knows me, knows my character.&quot;<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But while police ponder the unusual situation, a petition has now been launched in Brazil calling for the TV network Globo to take responsibility. So far around 700 people have signed it.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Globo have removed footage of the incident from its website, but the petition claims that Ali was unaware of what had happened until she was called to the &lsquo;diary room&rsquo;, or &lsquo;confessional&rsquo; as it is referred to in Brazil, and asked about what she remembered of the evening. She has since been quizzed by programme bosses.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>&quot;She still hasn't been informed of anything and, probably, never will be told of her rape,&quot; claims the petition. &quot;What Globo Network did was allow a rape to happen and then cover it, because of audience. There is no excuse for that.&quot;<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Now, according to the website of Brazilian gossip magazine Veja, police in Rio are investigating the seven minutes of footage, even though there has been no official allegation and the participants of the show are unaware of the furore. <br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In 2007 there was a similar allegation of rape in the South African version of the reality TV show. &middot;</p></p>
