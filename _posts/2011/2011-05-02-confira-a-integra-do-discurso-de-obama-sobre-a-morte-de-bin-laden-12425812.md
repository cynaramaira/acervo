<p><p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5; ">It was nearly 10 years ago that a bright September day was darkened by the worst attack on the American people in our history.&nbsp; The images of 9/11 are seared into our national memory -- hijacked planes cutting through a cloudless September sky; the Twin Towers collapsing to the ground; black smoke billowing up from the Pentagon; the wreckage of Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where the actions of heroic citizens saved even more heartbreak and destruction.</p></p>

<p><p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5; ">Over the last 10 years, thanks to the tireless and heroic work of our military and our counterterrorism professionals, we&rsquo;ve made great strides in that effort.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve disrupted terrorist attacks and strengthened our homeland defense.&nbsp; In Afghanistan, we removed the Taliban government, which had given bin Laden and al Qaeda safe haven and support.&nbsp; And around the globe, we worked with our friends and allies to capture or kill scores of al Qaeda terrorists, including several who were a part of the 9/11 plot.</p></p>
<p><p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5; ">Yet Osama bin Laden avoided capture and escaped across the Afghan border into Pakistan.&nbsp; Meanwhile, al Qaeda continued to operate from along that border and operate through its affiliates across the world.</p></p>

<p><p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5; ">Then, last August, after years of painstaking work by our intelligence community, I was briefed on a possible lead to bin Laden.&nbsp; It was far from certain, and it took many months to run this thread to ground.&nbsp; I met repeatedly with my national security team as we developed more information about the possibility that we had located bin Laden hiding within a compound deep inside of Pakistan.&nbsp; And finally, last week, I determined that we had enough intelligence to take action, and authorized an operation to get Osama bin Laden and bring him to justice.</p></p>

<p><p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5; ">As we do, we must also reaffirm that the United States is not &ndash;- and never will be -&ndash; at war with Islam.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve made clear, just as President Bush did shortly after 9/11, that our war is not against Islam.&nbsp; Bin Laden was not a Muslim leader; he was a mass murderer of Muslims.&nbsp; Indeed, al Qaeda has slaughtered scores of Muslims in many countries, including our own.&nbsp; So his demise should be welcomed by all who believe in peace and human dignity.</p></p>
<p><p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5; ">Over the years, I&rsquo;ve repeatedly made clear that we would take action within Pakistan if we knew where bin Laden was.&nbsp; That is what we&rsquo;ve done.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s important to note that our counterterrorism cooperation with Pakistan helped lead us to bin Laden and the compound where he was hiding.&nbsp; Indeed, bin Laden had declared war against Pakistan as well, and ordered attacks against the Pakistani people.</p></p>
<p><p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5; ">Tonight, I called President Zardari, and my team has also spoken with their Pakistani counterparts.&nbsp; They agree that this is a good and historic day for both of our nations.&nbsp; And going forward, it is essential that Pakistan continue to join us in the fight against al Qaeda and its affiliates.</p></p>

And on nights like this one, we can say to those families who have lost loved ones to al Qaeda&rsquo;s terror:&nbsp; Justice has been done.</p></p>
