<p><p>Dilma says she feels honored to be a woman in Presidency<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>Dilma Rousseff, Brazil's President elected, said today she feels honored to be the first woman to occupy the Presidency. She arrived at the Congress in this afternoon and made an inaugural speech. After that, she'll receive the Presidential sash from the hands of Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva, her predecessor and political mentor.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Dilma said she knows &quot;the historical significance of this decision&quot;.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Before that, she travelled from the Cathedral of Brasilia, in a Rolls Royce --a gift from England in 1952 to the former president Get&uacute;lio Vargas--, to the Esplanade of the Ministries under heavy rain. <br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In her speech, Dilma said that the former vice-president, Jos&eacute; Alencar, who is at a hospital in Sao Paulo, is a &quot;great brazilian&quot; and a &quot;tireless fighter&quot;.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>She also said that the former president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, changed the way Brazil was governed.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The president called for an overhaul of the tax code, signaling she will make the reform a priority in her government. Even more, said that ensuring price stability will be fundamental.<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Before being elected, Rousseff was Minister of Mines and Energy in the government of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva between 2003 and 2005, and then Chief of Cabinet from 2005 on. </p> </p>
